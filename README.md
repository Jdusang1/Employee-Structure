For this project we were to develop a command line application that allows the user to build out a team of employees. The user will be walked through a series of questions using the "Inquirer" extension of node.js, selecting the desired positions and entering their specific information. When finished the information would be rendered to an html page and deployed on the internet. A series of tests were to be used and passed by the application using "Jest" which is another node.js extension.
